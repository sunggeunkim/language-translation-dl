# Language Translation with Deep Learning
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to translate language using deep learning

## Install
To run the project, install the following packages:
* python3.5
* jupyter
* tensorflow (version >= 1.0.0)
* numpy

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run

```jupyter notebook dlnd_language_translation.ipynb```

## Algorithm
Recurrent Neural Network with encoding/decoding structure is used.
